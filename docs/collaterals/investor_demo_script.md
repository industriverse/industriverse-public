# Investor Demo: The Manufacturing AGI Loop
**"From Intent to Object: The First Self-Correcting Industrial AI"**

## 1. The Hook (0:00 - 0:30)
*   **Visual**: A blank screen with a single prompt box.
*   **Action**: User types: *"Make a lightweight precision bracket for a drone."*
*   **Voiceover**: "Manufacturing today is a thousand steps. We made it one."

## 2. The Brain (0:30 - 1:00)
*   **Visual**: Split screen showing the "Thought Process".
    *   **Intent Layer**: "Lightweight" -> `⊽0.1` (Fine Mill), "Precision" -> `⊸C` (Optical Align).
    *   **Capsule Network**: 27 Machines bid. "Precision Miller Alpha" wins (Score: 1.0).
*   **Voiceover**: "The system understands physics. It translates your intent into a thermodynamic contract."

## 3. The Shield (1:00 - 1:30)
*   **Visual**: A red warning flashes briefly, then turns green.
    *   *Simulated Threat*: "High RPM detected."
    *   *Mitigation*: "RPM clamped to 12,000. Plan Certified Safe."
*   **Voiceover**: "AI Shield v3 simulates the physics before a single motor moves. It's impossible to crash."

## 4. The Execution (1:30 - 2:30)
*   **Visual**: 
    *   **Left**: Real-time video of the machine (Visual Twin).
    *   **Right**: 3D Simulation (Shadow Twin).
    *   **Overlay**: "Energy: 245J | Cost: $0.15".
*   **Action**: The machine drifts (Temperature rises).
*   **Response**: The system autocorrects. "Thermal Drift Detected. Adjusting Feed Rate."
*   **Voiceover**: "It watches. It learns. It corrects."

## 5. The Close (2:30 - 3:00)
*   **Visual**: The finished part is held up.
*   **Text**: "The Industriverse. Built by Physics. Powered by AI."
*   **Call to Action**: "Join the Industrial Revolution."
