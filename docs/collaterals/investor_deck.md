# Slide 1: The Problem
## AI is "Hallucinating" in the Physical World

> [!WARNING]
> **The Risk:** Standard AI models (LLMs, Diffusion) are probabilistic. They make statistical guesses.
> **The Consequence:** In a chat window, a guess is a typo. In a fusion reactor, a guess is an explosion.

**We cannot build the future of energy on "maybe".**

# Slide 2: The Solution
## Thermodynamic Machine Learning (TMF)

We built the first AI platform that **cannot violate the laws of physics.**

*   **Energy Priors:** We embed Hamiltonian mechanics directly into the neural network.
*   **Conservation Compiler:** A "physics linter" that rejects unsafe commands.
*   **Sovereign Capsules:** Deployable, self-contained intelligence units.

**Result:** 100% Physics Compliance. Zero Hallucinations.

# Slide 3: The Product
## A Factory for Sovereign Intelligence

We don't just sell models. We sell **outcomes**.

| Product | Domain | Value Prop |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FUSION-ZERO** | Energy | Stabilize plasma, unlock net energy. |
| **FAB-SENTINEL** | Chips | Boost wafer yield by 15%. |
| **GRID-NEXUS** | Power | Prevent blackouts with virtual inertia. |
| **APPAREL-FLOW** | Retail | Auto-generate zero-waste patterns. |

# Slide 4: Traction
## 50 Demos. 27 Capsules. 1 Platform.

We haven't just written a whitepaper. We've built the code.

*   **50 Live Demos:** Running simulations of every major industrial sector.
*   **Discovery Loop v16:** Autonomous R&D engine.
*   **Living Whitepaper:** Our docs run live physics in the browser.

# Slide 5: The Ask
## Join the Genesis Mission.

We are raising capital to scale the **Thermodynamic ML Foundry**.

*   **Goal:** Deploy FUSION-ZERO to 3 National Labs in 12 months.
*   **Vision:** Become the standard OS for the $10T physical economy.

**Industriverse.**
*Aligning Intelligence with Reality.*
