# Trustless Production: Zero-Knowledge Manufacturing

**Empeiria Haus Research Series | Vol. 3**

---

## The Dilemma
To outsource manufacturing, you must share your design files (IP).
Once shared, your IP is vulnerable to theft.
How do you prove a part was made correctly *without* revealing how to make it?

## The Breakthrough: ZKMM (Zero-Knowledge Manufacturing Model)

### 1. Cryptographic Recipes
We wrap manufacturing instructions (G-code, recipes) in a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP).
*   **The Prover (Factory)**: Proves "I ran this code exactly as specified" without revealing the code.
*   **The Verifier (Client)**: Confirms the proof without seeing the factory's internal data.

### 2. The Trustless Supply Chain
*   **IP Protection**: Design files are never exposed in plaintext.
*   **Quality Assurance**: Mathematical guarantee of process adherence.

## The Market
*   **Defense**: Secure distributed manufacturing.
*   **Pharma**: Protecting drug formulas while outsourcing production.
*   **Semiconductors**: Protecting lithography masks.

> "Manufacture anywhere. Trust mathematics."
