# The Capsule Economy: A Sovereign Skill Market

**Empeiria Haus Research Series | Vol. 4**

---

## The Concept: An App Store for Matter
In the Industriverse, a "skill" (e.g., High-Speed Milling, TIG Welding) is a software container called a **Capsule**.
Capsules are:
*   **Portable**: Run on any machine (via Docker/WASM).
*   **Sovereign**: Owned by their creator (cryptographically signed).
*   **Monetizable**: Licensed per-use or per-month.

## The Marketplace Mechanics (DCE)

### 1. Distributed Capsule Economy (DCE)
A decentralized marketplace where Capsules bid for work.
*   **The Bid**: "I can weld this seam for $0.50 energy cost with 99.9% quality."
*   **The Selection**: The machine selects the best Capsule for the job.

### 2. The PSSM (Physics-Sovereign Skill Model)
Capsules evolve. A Capsule that learns a better way to mill titanium updates itself and increases its value.
Creators earn royalties on every execution.

## The Revenue Model
We take a transaction fee on every skill exchange.
As the library of skills grows, the value of the entire network compounds.

> "Software eats the world. Capsules eat the factory."
