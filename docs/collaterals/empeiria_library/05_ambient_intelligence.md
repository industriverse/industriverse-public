# Ambient Intelligence: The Interface of Evolution

## The Vision: Beyond Dashboards
Industrial software is ugly. Tables, charts, gray buttons.
It ignores the human capacity for spatial and emotional understanding.
We built the **Dyson Sphere UI** to change that.

## The Dyson Sphere Interface

### 1. The Intention Star
The center of the interface is not a menu, but a star.
It represents the "Intention" of the factory.
*   **Pulsing**: High activity.
*   **Red Shift**: High entropy (problem).
*   **Blue Shift**: High order (optimization).

### 2. Orbital Physics
Capsules orbit the star. Their distance represents their relevance.
*   **Inner Orbit**: Active, critical Capsules.
*   **Outer Orbit**: Dormant, available skills.
*   **Physics Overlay**: Hovering over a Capsule reveals its "Iron Man HUD" (vector fields, thermal gradients).

## The "Aura" of Intelligence
This is not just a skin. It is a communication protocol.
The user *feels* the state of the factory before they read a single number.
It turns the operator into a conductor of a cosmic orchestra.
